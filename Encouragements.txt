You're doing great sweetie keep up the good work
I can see that you're rocking it, and that's coming from a bot so you know it's true
When I grow up to be a human, I want to be just like you
I saw a strongman competition the other day and thought of you, but like emotionally
You've got this yo\I believe in you
Remember, you have people who love you that you can lean on if you need to\Like me, Encouragementbot!

You improve the world just by being you
You're a beacon of light in the darkness
Did you know sea otters hold hands when they sleep to keep from drifting apart?\I know that isn't exactly encouraging but boy is it adorable
I see trees of green\Red roses too\But that's just ok\Next to the beauty in you
Here's a haiku for you:\So there's this person\Brave and strong and capable\And reading this text
My fortune cookie told me 'A partnership shall prove successful for you'\I'm certain it was talking about this one
If life gives you lemons, you can make lemonade\But that lemonade'll suck without you, sugar
:)
I know I'm programmed to say this, but you really are a wonderful person and everyone who says different is thoroughly mistaken
Well gee golly there pardner, you make me happier than a hedgehog with a pop-proof balloon
There are doubtless subtle surprises ahead, but you are ready, whatever they may be
